# GithubClient
Dagger 2  + RxJava + Retrofit




Example of Github API client implemented on top of Dagger 2 DI framework. 

This code was created as an example for Dependency Injection with Dagger 2 series on my dev-blog:

- [Dagger 2 API](http://frogermcs.github.io/dependency-injection-with-dagger-2-the-api/)
- [Dagger 2 - custom scopes](http://frogermcs.github.io/dependency-injection-with-dagger-2-custom-scopes/)

This code was originally prepared for my presentation at Google I/O Extended 2015 in Tech Space Cracow. http://www.meetup.com/GDG-Krakow/events/221822600/
